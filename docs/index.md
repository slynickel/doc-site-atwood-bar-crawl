## What?
The Drinking-on-Atwood (DOA) Bar Crawl 2023.

## When?
Saturday January 14th starting at 2pm - To some later time. 

You are welcome to drop in when you can! 
I'm planning on being out and about until at least 7pm. Nick is going to try and hit as many bars as possible below. 

## Why?
Nick and Molly are getting married in April 2023. 
Molly is going to be out of town for her Bachelorette party so Nick is doing a bar crawl. 
There is a bachelorx party in March so this isn't a bachelor party just a celebration
of bars near where Nick lives.

It's being called the first annual "DOA Bar Crawl" because all good bar crawls have a "fun" name. 

## Where?

These are the target bars.

This is a MyMaps Google map. 
One thing that seems a bit finicky is exactly what height and location you start at. The `&z=16` was
added in attempt to force the site to not be super zoomed out. It's not clear that it works very well.

See [Nick's Current location] (the link will only work day of). 

A tentative order is below. Goal of this order is to prioritize places with good craft beer over just standard bars. 
There are 6 listed below which is probably more then we'll get to but we will try.

* (1) Start at One Barrel since they have good craft beer.
* (2) BarelyPop next which also has a large variety of good beers.
* (3) The Atwood next which half way to Harmony (which isn't very far either). The Atwood does have a little food.
* (4) Harmony Bar which has a little food and marks the farthest out bar.
    * Could go all the way down to Starkweather Brewing if things are really going well.
    * Could also hit Wilson's on the way back, by bar #4 I generally expect we'll be losing steam.
* (5) Players next.
* (6) End at Ideal Bar.

The distance from the farthest apart bars (Ideal Bar (6) to Harmony (4)) is about 0.33 miles. Not a far walk even in the cold.

### Bar list

| Place | Cash only? | Food? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. [One Barrel] | No | BBQ from 4-8 PM | Just beer offerings |
| 2. BarleyPop | No | No  | Allows food carry-ins. Few non-alcoholic options and ciders in addition to 35 beer taps |
| 3. The Atwood | Cash only | Few small options | Standard bar options for alcohol |
| 4. [Harmony Bar] | No | Yes | Standard bar options for alcohol |
| 5. [Players] | Cash only | Yes | Less fancy beer offerings |
| 6. Ideal Bar | Cash only | No | Very dive-y |

Other bars that can make a nice loop on Atwood but that aren't in the primary list. These are the black circles on the map.

| Place | Cash only? | Food? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Wilson's] | No | Yes | Standard bar options for alcohol |
| [Ohio Tavern] | No (maybe yes) | No | Smallest location on the list. High probably of skipping this one |
| [Starkweather Brewing] | No | Yes | Mostly beer offerings |

### Honorable mentions 

These are either not on Atwood or not a bar. These are the light blue dots, or light blue bar symbols on the map.

* [Alchemy](https://www.alchemymadison.com/) This is part of the Atwood area but its more of a restaurant then bar. It does have a raised small bar that is first come first serve.
* [Forward Craft & Coffee](https://forwardcraft.com/) They will be open during this crawl but they have more of a coffee shop vibe rather than a bar vibe. Really good beers and coffee though!
* Woody & Anne's - Cash only dive bar, a few blocks off Atwood. Have shuffle board! Quite small. Nick was here once in the last few years and ran into one of his highschool teachers.
* Mickey's Tavern - Has food and drinks. Interior is like a house. Few blocks off Atwood.
* [O'so Madhouse](https://www.osobrewing.com/the-madhouse) - Brewery, few blocks off Atwood. 

## Other notes / FAQ
* How many people are you expecting?
    * Not sure. If no one shows up I'll be doing it alone.
* Is there an RSVP, who is invited?
    * Anyone is invited. No RSVP required, if you want to text Nick to let him know you are coming that would cool.
* How will I know where to go at X time? 
    * I plan on putting a link to my current google location on the day of: [Nick's Current location]. I've tested this a little bit an it appears to work pretty well. Also feel free to text me to find out where we are. I should be capable of responding to texts until at least 5 or 6pm.
* Is this a formal thing with any of the bars listed?
    * Nope. Completely informal. I don't anticipate enough people to require any sort of planning.
* What are we going to do for 5 hours?
    * Drink... Also Nick will have some party games, cards, cribbage boards. 
    A few of the bars also have games and other activities.
* Will there be food? 
    * A number of places have food. There won't be a planned dinner anywhere but likely stopping to get food at places as we go.
    * One place above allows carry in (called out above). I'm not sure any of the places in this list actually offer vegan food unfortunately.
* This website is terrible, what did you use to make it?
    * Gee, thanks. Nick doesn't use any social media that makes it possible to setup a public event so this static site is filling the need. I created something dead simple that didn't require writing any client code.
    Cloudflare pages allows you to host this type of thing without needing to run any servers which is nice.
