## What?
The Drinking-on-Atwood (DOA) Bar Crawl 2023.

## When?
Saturday January 14th starting at 2pm - To some later time. 

You are welcome to drop in when you can! 
I'm planning on being out and about until at least 7pm. Nick is going to try and hit as many bars as possible below. 

## Why?
Nick and Molly are getting married in April 2023. 
Molly is going to be out of town for her Bachelorette party so Nick is doing a bar crawl. 
There is a bachelorx party in March so this isn't a bachelor party just a celebration
of bars near where Nick lives.

It's being called the first annual "DOA Bar Crawl" because all good bar crawls have a "fun" name. 

## Where?

These are the target bars. A tentative order is below.

Goal of this order is to start on the west side of Atwood and work our way east then back. If we make it to Starkweather brewing that'll be the farthest east, then head back hitting bars we didn't hit on the way out there. Realistically we aren't going to hit all of these. Some are pretty small which would be tough to go to with more than 5 or 6 people. Likely picking up food as we go.

### Honorable mentions 

These are either not on Atwood or not a bar, possible we could consider them.

* Woody & Anne's - Cash only dive bar, a few blocks off Atwood. Have shuffle board! Quite small. Nick was here once in the last few years and ran into one of his highschool teachers.
* Mickey's Tavern - Has food and drinks. Interior is like a house. Few blocks off Atwood.
* [O'so Madhouse](https://www.osobrewing.com/the-madhouse) - Brewery, few blocks off Atwood. 

## Other notes / FAQ
* How many people are you expecting?
    * Not sure. If no one shows up I'll be doing it alone.
* Is there an RSVP, who is invited?
    * There isn't any RSVP, anyone is invited. If you want to text Nick to let him know you are coming that would cool.
* Is this a formal thing with any of the bars listed?
    * Nope. Completely informal. I don't anticipate enough people to require any sort of planning.
* What are we going to do for 5 hours?
    * Drink... Also Nick will have some party games, cards, cribbages boards. 
    A few of the bars also have games and other activities.
* Will there be food? 
    * A number of places have food. There won't be a planned dinner anywhere but likely stopping to get food at places as we go.
    * A few of the places allow carry in (called out above). There are a number of vegan places on the Atwood.
* This website is terrible, what did you use to make it?
    * Gee, thanks. Nick doesn't use any social media that makes it possible to setup a public event so this static site is filling the need. Cloudflare pages allows you to host this type of thing without needing to run any servers which is nice.
