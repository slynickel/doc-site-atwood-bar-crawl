## What?
The Drinking-on-Atwood (DOA) Bar Crawl 2023.

## When?
Saturday January 14th starting at 2pm - To some later time. 

You are welcome to drop in when you can! 
I'm planning on being out and about until at least 7pm. Nick is going to try and hit as many bars as possible below. 

## Why?
Nick and Molly are getting married in April 2023. 
Molly is going to be out of town for her Bachelorette party so Nick is doing a bar crawl. 
There is a bachelorx party in March so this isn't a bachelor party just a celebration
of bars near where Nick lives.

It's being called the first annual "DOA Bar Crawl" because all good bar crawls have a "fun" name. 

## Where?

These are the target bars. A tentative order is below.

See [Nick's Current location] (the link will only work day of). 

Goal of this order is to prioritize places with good craft beer over just standard bars. Realistically we aren't going to hit all of these. The list is optimistically listing off 7 bars.

* (2) Start at One Barrel since they have good craft beer.
* (4) BarelyPop next which also has a large variety of good beers.
* (7) Harmony Bar which has a little food and is about halfway to Starkweather.
* (9) Starkweather Brewing for the farthest down bar
    * (8) Possibly Ohio Tavern prior to Starkweather Brewing if the group is small enough at this point. They do have good Tacos but the place is on the smaller side.
* (6) Wilson's next which has some food.
    * (5) Could hit The Atwood next but at this point I'm guessing we'll be losing steam. Not missing much skipping this one. Could also do The Atwood instead of Wilson's they are similar.
* (3) Players next. Back to back sports bars.
* (1) End at Ideal Bar. It's the closest to Nick's apartment.

The distance from Ideal Bar (1) to Starkweather Brewing (9) is about 0.5 miles. Not a far walk even in the cold.

### Honorable mentions 

These are either not on Atwood or not a bar, possible we could consider them.

* [Alchemy](https://www.alchemymadison.com/) This is part of the Atwood area but its more of a restaurant then bar. It does have a raised small bar that is first come first serve.
* Woody & Anne's - Cash only dive bar, a few blocks off Atwood. Have shuffle board! Quite small. Nick was here once in the last few years and ran into one of his highschool teachers.
* Mickey's Tavern - Has food and drinks. Interior is like a house. Few blocks off Atwood.
* [O'so Madhouse](https://www.osobrewing.com/the-madhouse) - Brewery, few blocks off Atwood. 

## Other notes / FAQ
* How many people are you expecting?
    * Not sure. If no one shows up I'll be doing it alone.
* Is there an RSVP, who is invited?
    * Anyone is invited. No RSVP required but I may write a little app to accept RSVPs if I get around to it. If you want to text Nick to let him know you are coming that would cool.
* How will I know where to go at X time? 
    * I plan on putting a link to my current google location on the day of: [Nick's Current location]. I've tested this a little bit an it appears to work pretty well. Also feel free to text me to find out where we are. I should be capable of responding to texts at until at least 5 or 6pm.
* Is this a formal thing with any of the bars listed?
    * Nope. Completely informal. I don't anticipate enough people to require any sort of planning.
* What are we going to do for 5 hours?
    * Drink... Also Nick will have some party games, cards, cribbage boards. 
    A few of the bars also have games and other activities.
* Will there be food? 
    * A number of places have food. There won't be a planned dinner anywhere but likely stopping to get food at places as we go.
    * A few of the places allow carry in (called out above). I'm not sure any of the places in this list actually offer vegan food unfortunately.
* This website is terrible, what did you use to make it?
    * Gee, thanks. Nick doesn't use any social media that makes it possible to setup a public event so this static site is filling the need. Cloudflare pages allows you to host this type of thing without needing to run any servers which is nice.
    * See [slynickel/doc-site-atwood-bar-crawl](https://github.com/slynickel/doc-site-atwood-bar-crawl) for the source.
